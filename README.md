# CS211Projects
An archive of projects for George Mason University's Intro to Object Oriented Programming course.

These are all of the major projects and exercises I had to complete for class credit during the course.
The course was based in Java and taught by Professor Socrates Dimitrious.

More than just a storage space, this archive also displays my progress throughout the course.
It showcases how my understanding of the language increases as time progresses, helping me develop
better programs, expanding my knowledge on OOP principles, and changing the way I approach obstacles
and my solutions to get pass them.

These projects are in no way perfect. 
Each project has its own set of issues, whether its logical or syntactic flaws.
As I said, they are meant to showcase my development.

Each folder will contain the following:
-  The given instructions for the project/exercise, which are specifications for the project, including restrictions and requirements in order to receive full marks.
-  The program files, earlier projects are not javadocced, but later ones are.
Some folders include a tester file I used to try my program before submitting the final product.

As required by the course, all programs were developed in Java 8.
Virtual Studio Code was the main IDE used for development.

I appreciate your time in viewing my progress.
This archive is also a progress checker for my future self.
Hopefully, in a few years, I have established myself as a decent programmer in whatever field I decided to persure.
